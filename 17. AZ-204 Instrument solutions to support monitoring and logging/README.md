# Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor delivers a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. This information helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identify issues affecting them and the resources they depend on.

The following diagram gives a high-level view of Azure Monitor. At the center of the diagram are the data stores for metrics and logs, which are the two fundamental types of data used by Azure Monitor. On the left are the sources of monitoring data that populate these data stores. On the right are the different functions that Azure Monitor performs with this collected data. This includes such actions as analysis, alerting, and streaming to external systems.


# What data does Azure Monitor collect?

Azure Monitor can collect data from a variety of sources. This ranges from your application, any operating system and services it relies on, down to the platform itself. Azure Monitor collects data from each of the following tiers:

- Application monitoring data: Data about the performance and functionality of the code you have written, regardless of its platform.
- Guest OS monitoring data: Data about the operating system on which your application is running. This could be running in Azure, another cloud, or on-premises.
- Azure resource monitoring data: Data about the operation of an Azure resource. For a complete list of the resources that have metrics or logs, visit [What can you monitor with Azure Monitor?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/monitor-reference#list-of-azure-monitor-supported-services)
- Azure subscription monitoring data: Data about the operation and management of an Azure subscription, as well as data about the health and operation of Azure itself.
- Azure tenant monitoring data: Data about the operation of tenant-level Azure services, such as Azure Active Directory.


# Monitoring data platform

All data collected by Azure Monitor fits into one of two fundamental types, metrics and logs. Metrics are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a particular point in time. They are lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time scenarios. Logs contain different kinds of data organized into records with different sets of properties for each type. Telemetry such as events and traces are stored as logs in addition to performance data so that it can all be combined for analysis.

For many Azure resources, you'll see metric data collected by Azure Monitor right in their Overview page in the Azure portal. Log data collected by Azure Monitor can be analyzed with queries to quickly retrieve, consolidate, and analyze collected data. You can create and test queries using Log Analytics in the Azure portal.


# Insights and curated visualizations

Monitoring data is only useful if it can increase your visibility into the operation of your computing environment. Some Azure resource providers have a "curated visualization" which gives you a customized monitoring experience for that particular service or set of services. They generally require minimal configuration. Larger scalable curated visualizations are known at "insights" and marked with that name in the documentation and Azure portal. Some examples are:

- Application Insights: Application Insights monitors the availability, performance, and usage of your web applications whether they're hosted in the cloud or on-premises. It leverages the powerful data analysis platform in Azure Monitor to provide you with deep insights into your application's operations. It enables you to diagnose errors without waiting for a user to report them.
- Container Insights: Container Insights monitors the performance of container workloads that are deployed to managed Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Container Instances. It gives you performance visibility by collecting metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers that are available in Kubernetes through the Metrics API. Container logs are also collected.
- VM Insights: VM Insights monitors your Azure virtual machines (VM) at scale. It analyzes the performance and health of your Windows and Linux VMs and identifies their different processes and interconnected dependencies on external processes.
