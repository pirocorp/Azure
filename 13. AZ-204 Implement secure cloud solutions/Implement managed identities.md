# Managed Identities

Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. Applications may use the managed identity to obtain Azure AD tokens. For example, an application may use a managed identity to access resources like Azure Key Vault where developers can store credentials in a secure manner or to access storage accounts.


# Types of managed identities

There are two types of managed identities:

- A system-assigned managed identity is enabled directly on an Azure service instance. When the identity is enabled, Azure creates an identity for the instance in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription of the instance. After the identity is created, the credentials are provisioned onto the instance. The lifecycle of a system-assigned identity is directly tied to the Azure service instance that it's enabled on. If the instance is deleted, Azure automatically cleans up the credentials and the identity in Azure AD.
- A user-assigned managed identity is created as a standalone Azure resource. Through a create process, Azure creates an identity in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription in use. After the identity is created, the identity can be assigned to one or more Azure service instances. The lifecycle of a user-assigned identity is managed separately from the lifecycle of the Azure service instances to which it's assigned.

Internally, managed identities are service principals of a special type, which are locked to only be used with Azure resources. When the managed identity is deleted, the corresponding service principal is automatically removed.


# Characteristics of managed identities

The table below highlights some of the key differences between the two types of managed identities.

| Characteristic                 	| System-assigned managed identity                                                                                                                                  	| User-assigned managed identity                                                                              	|
|--------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Creation                       	| Created as part of an Azure resource (for example, an Azure virtual machine or Azure App Service)                                                                 	| Created as a stand-alone Azure resource                                                                     	|
| Lifecycle                      	| Shared lifecycle with the Azure resource that the managed identity is created with. When the parent resource is deleted, the managed identity is deleted as well. 	| Independent life-cycle. Must be explicitly deleted.                                                         	|
| Sharing across Azure resources 	| Cannot be shared, it can only be associated with a single Azure resource.                                                                                         	| Can be shared, the same user-assigned managed identity can be associated with more than one Azure resource. 	|


# When to use managed identities

The image below gives an overview the scenarios that support using managed identities. For example, you can use managed identities if you want to build an app using Azure App Services that accesses Azure Storage without having to manage any credentials.

# What Azure services support managed identities?

Managed identities for Azure resources can be used to authenticate to services that support Azure Active Directory authentication. For a list of Azure services that support the managed identities for Azure resources feature, visit [Services that support managed identities for Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-msi).

The rest of this module will use Azure virtual machines in the examples, but the same concepts and similar actions can be applied to any resource in Azure that supports Azure Active Directory authentication.
