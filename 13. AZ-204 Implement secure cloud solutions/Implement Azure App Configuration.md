# Azure App Configuration service

Modern programs, especially programs running in a cloud, generally have many components that are distributed in nature. Spreading configuration settings across these components can lead to hard-to-troubleshoot errors during an application deployment. Use App Configuration to store all the settings for your application and secure their access in one place.

App Configuration offers the following benefits:

- A fully managed service that can be set up in minutes
- Flexible key representations and mappings
- Tagging with labels
- Point-in-time replay of settings
- Dedicated UI for feature flag management
- Comparison of two sets of configurations on custom-defined dimensions
- Enhanced security through Azure-managed identities
- Complete data encryptions, at rest or in transit
- Native integration with popular frameworks

App Configuration complements Azure Key Vault, which is used to store application secrets. App Configuration makes it easier to implement the following scenarios:

- Centralize management and distribution of hierarchical configuration data for different environments and geographies
- Dynamically change application settings without the need to redeploy or restart an application
- Control feature availability in real-time
