# Introduction

Azure Cosmos DB uses partitioning to scale individual containers in a database to meet the performance needs of your application.


## Explore partitions

In partitioning, the items in a container are divided into distinct subsets called logical partitions. Logical partitions are formed based on the value of a partition key that is associated with each item in a container. All the items in a logical partition have the same partition key value.

For example, a container holds items. Each item has a unique value for the UserID property. If UserID serves as the partition key for the items in the container and there are 1,000 unique UserID values, 1,000 logical partitions are created for the container.

In addition to a partition key that determines the item's logical partition, each item in a container has an item ID which is unique within a logical partition. Combining the partition key and the item ID creates the item's index, which uniquely identifies the item. Choosing a partition key is an important decision that will affect your application's performance.


## Logical partitions

A logical partition consists of a set of items that have the same partition key. For example, in a container that contains data about food nutrition, all items contain a foodGroup property. You can use foodGroup as the partition key for the container. Groups of items that have specific values for foodGroup, such as Beef Products, Baked Products, and Sausages and Luncheon Meats, form distinct logical partitions.

A logical partition also defines the scope of database transactions. You can update items within a logical partition by using a transaction with snapshot isolation. When new items are added to a container, new logical partitions are transparently created by the system. You don't have to worry about deleting a logical partition when the underlying data is deleted.


## Physical partitions

A container is scaled by distributing data and throughput across physical partitions. Internally, one or more logical partitions are mapped to a single physical partition. Typically smaller containers have many logical partitions but they only require a single physical partition. Unlike logical partitions, physical partitions are an internal implementation of the system and they are entirely managed by Azure Cosmos DB.

The number of physical partitions in your container depends on the following:

- The number of throughput provisioned (each individual physical partition can provide a throughput of up to 10,000 request units per second). The 10,000 RU/s limit for physical partitions implies that logical partitions also have a 10,000 RU/s limit, as each logical partition is only mapped to one physical partition.
- The total data storage (each individual physical partition can store up to 50GB data).


**Note**

Physical partitions are an internal implementation of the system and they are entirely managed by Azure Cosmos DB. When developing your solutions, don't focus on physical partitions because you can't control them. Instead, focus on your partition keys. If you choose a partition key that evenly distributes throughput consumption across logical partitions, you will ensure that throughput consumption across physical partitions is balanced.

Throughput provisioned for a container is divided evenly among physical partitions. A partition key design that doesn't distribute requests evenly might result in too many requests directed to a small subset of partitions that become "hot." Hot partitions lead to inefficient use of provisioned throughput, which might result in rate-limiting and higher costs.
