# [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)

- Accelerate containerized application development
- Manage Kubernetes with ease
- Build on an enterprise-grade, more secure foundation
- Run any workload in the cloud, at the edge, or as a hybrid

## Container Orchestration

- Workload deployment and distribution
- Resource governance
- Scalability and availability
- Automatization and management
- Internal and external communication


## What Kubernetes Does?

- **Run a cluster** of hosts.
- **Schedule containers** to run on different hosts.
- Facilitate the **communication between** the **containers**.
- Provide and control access to/from **outside world**.
- Track and optimize the **resource usage**.


## Architecture Overview

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/159252034-da006e4a-9599-4749-a898-59d5dfbcd660.png)


## Masters

- Responsible for **managing** the cluster.
- Typically, **more than one** is installed.
- In HA mode one Master node is the **Leader**.
- It is **work-free**.
- Components running on master are also known as **Control Plane**.
- Can be reached via **CLI (kubectl)**, **APIs**, or **Dashboard**.

## (Worker) Nodes

- Initially called **Minions**
- **Container runtime**
    - containerd, rkt, lxd
- **Kubelet**
    - Communicates with master
    - Uses CRI shims
- **kube-proxy** 
    - Network proxy

## Pods

- Smallest **unit of scheduling**.
- **One** or **more** containers.
- Containers **share** the pod **environment**.
- **Scheduled** on nodes.
- It is **atomic** â€“ **deployed as one** and on **one node**.
- Created via **manifest files**.

- Each pod has **unique IP** address.
- **Inter-pod** communication is via a **pod network**.
- **Intra-pod** communication is via **localhost** and **port**.

## Replication Controllers

- **Higher** level workload.
- Looks after **pod** or **set of pods**.
- **Scale** up/down **pods**.
- Sets **Desired State**.

## Deployments

- **Even higher** level workload.
- Simplifies **updates** and **rollbacks**.
- **Declarative** and **imperative** approach.
- Self **documenting**.
- Suitable for **versioning**.

## Services

- Provide reliable network endpoint
  - **IP address**
  - **DNS name**
  - **Port**
- Expose Pods to the outside world
  - **NodePort** (cluster-wide port)
  - **LoadBalancer** (cloud-based)
- Use End Point object to track Pods

# DevOps

## [What is DevOps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-devops)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/159258140-761462a3-918d-43c3-a277-47b69b5a2810.png)


## The Road to DevOps

- **Understand your Cycle Time** - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.
- **Become Data-Informed** - Use data to inform what to do in your next cycle.
- **Strive for Validated Learning** - Feedback gathered with each cycle should be real, actionable data.
- **Shorten your Cycle Time** - Smaller batches, more automation, improved telemetry, frequent deployments.
- **Optimize Validated Learning** - The sum of improvements that you achieve and the failures that you avoid.


## How to Achieve DevOps?

## Continuous (Something)

**Continuous Integration** - Series of steps that are automatically performed to integrate code from multiple sources, create a build and test.
**Continuous Delivery** - Helps you build a refined version of the software by continuously implementing fixes and feedback until finally, you decide to push it out to production.
**Continuous Deployment** - Every change goes through an automated pipeline and a working version of the application is automatically pushed to production.


## CD vs CD
