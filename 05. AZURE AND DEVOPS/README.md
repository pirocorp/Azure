# Azure Kubernetes Service

Container Orchestration

- Workload deployment and distribution
- Resource governance
- Scalability and availability
- Automatization and management
- Internal and external communication


What Kubernetes Does?

- **Run a cluster** of hosts.
- **Schedule containers** to run on different hosts.
- Facilitate the **communication between** the **containers**.
- Provide and control access to/from **outside world**.
- Track and optimize the **resource usage**.


## Architecture Overview

### Masters

- Responsible for **managing** the cluster.
- Typically, **more than one** is installed.
- In HA mode one Master node is the **Leader**.
- It is **work-free**.
- Components running on master are also known as **Control Plane**.
- Can be reached via **CLI (kubectl)**, **APIs**, or **Dashboard**.

### (Worker) Nodes

- Initially called **Minions**
- **Container runtime**
    - containerd, rkt, lxd
- **Kubelet**
    - Communicates with master
    - Uses CRI shims
- **kube-proxy** 
    - Network proxy

### Pods

- Smallest **unit of scheduling**.
- **One** or **more** containers.
- Containers **share** the pod **environment**.
- **Scheduled** on nodes.
- It is **atomic** â€“ **deployed as one** and on **one node**.
- Created via **manifest files**.

- Each pod has **unique IP** address.
- **Inter-pod** communication is via a **pod network**.
- **Intra-pod** communication is via **localhost** and **port**.
