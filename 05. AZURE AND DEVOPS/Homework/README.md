# AKS task

- Create an AKS cluster with one node
- Prepare a simple web app (single static HTML page) with one picture (or whatever you decide) and a text with your SoftUni ID
- Create a Dockerfile to containerize the app
- Create an ACR and publish the app image there
- Create a manifest (or two) and deploy the app on the cluster

You may use the files and the steps from the practice to help yourself.

# DevOps task

- Create an AKS cluster with one node or reuse the one created earlier
- Publish the app created earlier in a code repository (for example in GitHub)
