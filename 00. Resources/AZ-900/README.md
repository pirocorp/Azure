- Data Centres Overview: 
	- **Current Data Centers**: The current data centre locations are Paris and Brussels. The Brussels data centre would be replaced with two new data centres.
	- **Storage and Compute**: The storage and compute services available in the data centres, including virtual machines, containers, and databases. The use of VMware and Nutanix for managing these services.
 	- **Networking Components**: The networking components involved in the data centres, including the DMZ, firewalls, and connections for customers to access the environment.

- Azure Overview
	- **Regions** - Azure regions are locations where data centers are coupled. Regions consist of multiple data centers.
	- **Availability Zones** - Groups of data centers within a region that provide redundancy and connectivity. Most regions have at least three availability zones to ensure high availability.
	- **Redundancy and Connectivity** - Importance of availability zones for redundancy and connectivity, ensuring that services remain available even if one data center fails.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure as code (IaaS) in Azure includes virtual machines, storage, and networking components. These services are managed as code, allowing for automation and scalability.
- **Platform as a Service**: Platform as a service (PaaS) offerings, which are built on top of the IaaS layer. Services like databases and web applications simplify management and reduce the need for manual updates.
	- **Service Integration**: PaaS services are often built on top of IaaS components, providing a higher level of abstraction and ease of use for developers â€” examples like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and SQL databases.
- **Software as a Service**: Software as a service (SaaS) examples like Office 365 and Power Platform. Emphasized the ease of use and scalability of SaaS offerings, which require minimal configuration and management.
	-  **Software as a service (SaaS)** involves providing fully managed applications that require minimal configuration and management. He highlighted the ease of use and scalability of SaaS offerings.
