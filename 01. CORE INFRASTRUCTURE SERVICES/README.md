# Cloud Building Blocks

- **Infrastructure** - Physical resources in the data center of the cloud service provider (CSP) â€“ servers, storage, network equipment, software
- **Resource Sharing** - A combination of hardware and software, responsible for isolation and resource sharing, usually delivers services via virtualization.
- **Development Platforms** - Provides functional support (API) for cloud applications. APIs include cloud storage access, user authentication, etc.
- **Application Software** - System components used by the end-users.

# Types of Cloud Computing

Based on who operates (owns) the cloud, who has access to the cloud services.

- **Public** - The Cloud provider is the owner of the cloud infrastructure. Services are accessible to the public over the Internet. Users can consume services without purchasing and setting up hardware and software. Charging for services usage by the users is typically done for the duration of use.

- **Sovereign clouds** - These public clouds are physically isolated from other public clouds. Only specific organizations have access to sovereign clouds like governments or countries (US, Germany, China, etc.).

- **Private** - An organization owns a cloud infrastructure. The cloud environment is procured, set up, operated, and maintained by the organization. Infrastructure is accessible to specific users via the intranet. End users are sharing resources. The organization defines security and terms of use. 

- **Hybrid** - Infrastructure includes an owned private cloud and a leased public cloud. The organization uses its private cloud most of the time. Only when needed, offload tasks and data to the public cloud. This process is known as cloud bursting. For dealing with regulatory requirements can be used cloud bursting.
