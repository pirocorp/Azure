## Review

In this exercise, you created an Azure **Service Bus** namespace and a **Service Bus** queue that you'll use through the remainder of the lab.


# Create a .NET Core project to publish messages to a Service Bus queue

## Create a .NET Core project

Create a new .NET project named **MessagePublisher**. Import the **Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus** package from NuGet. Build the .NET Core console application.


## Publish messages to an Azure Service Bus queue

Open the **Program.cs** file. On the code editor tab for the **Program.cs** file, delete all the code in the existing file. Add the following lines of code to facilitate the use of the built-in namespaces that will be referenced in this file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```


Add the following code to import the **Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus** namespace included in the **Azure.Storage.Queues** package imported from NuGet:

```csharp
using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
```


Enter the following code to create a new **Program** class in the MessagePublisher namespace:

```csharp
namespace MessagePublisher
{
    public class Program
    {
    }
}
```


In the **Program** class, enter the following code to create a string constant named **storageConnectionString**:

```csharp
private const string storageConnectionString = "";
```

Update the **storageConnectionString** string constant by setting its value to **Primary Connection String** of the Service Bus namespace you recorded earlier in this lab.


Enter the following code to create a string constant named **queueName** with a value of **messagequeue**, matching the name of the Service Bus queue you created earlier in this exercise.

```csharp
private const string queueName = "messagequeue";
```


Enter the following code to create an integer constant which stores the number of messages to be sent to the target queue:

```csharp
private const int numOfMessages = 3;
```


Enter the following code to create a Service Bus client that will own the connection to the target queue:

```csharp
static ServiceBusClient client;
```


Enter the following code to create a Service Bus sender that will be used to publish messages to the target queue:

```csharp
static ServiceBusSender sender;
```


Enter the following code to create an asynchronous **Main** method:

```csharp
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
}
```


Review the **Program.cs** file, which should now include the following code. Note that the `<storage-connection-string>` placeholder represents the connection string to the target Azure Service Bus namespace:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
namespace MessagePublisher
{
  public class Program
  {
      private const string storageConnectionString = "<storage-connection-string>";
      private const string queueName = "messagequeue";
      private const int numOfMessages = 3;
      static ServiceBusClient client;
      static ServiceBusSender sender;
      public static async Task Main(string[] args)
      {
      }
  }
}
```


In the **Main** method, add the following code to initialize *client* of type **ServiceBusClient** that will provide connectivity to the Service Bus namespace and **sender** that will be responsible for sending messages:

```csharp
client = new ServiceBusClient(storageConnectionString);
sender = client.CreateSender(queueName);  
```

> **Note**: The Service Bus client is safe to cache and use as a singleton for the lifetime of the application. This is considered one of the best practices when publishing and reading messages on a regular basis.


In the **Main** method, add the following code to create a **ServiceBusMessageBatch** object that will allow you to combine multiple messages into a batch by using the **TryAddMessage** method:

```csharp
using ServiceBusMessageBatch messageBatch = await sender.CreateMessageBatchAsync();
```


In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to add messages to a batch and throw an exception if a message size exceeds the limits supported by the batch:

```csharp
for (int i = 1; i <= numOfMessages; i++)
{
	if (!messageBatch.TryAddMessage(new ServiceBusMessage($"Message {i}")))
	{
		throw new Exception($"The message {i} is too large to fit in the batch.");
	}
}
```


In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to create a try block, with **sender** asynchronously publishing messages in the batch to the target queue:

```csharp
try
{
	await sender.SendMessagesAsync(messageBatch);
	Console.WriteLine($"A batch of {numOfMessages} messages has been published to the queue.");
}
```


In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to create a finally block that asynchronously disposes of the **sender** and **client** objects, releasing any network and unmanaged resources:

```csharp
finally
{
	await sender.DisposeAsync();
	await client.DisposeAsync();
}
```


Review the **Main** method, which should now consist of the following code: 

```csharp
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
	client = new ServiceBusClient(storageConnectionString);
	sender = client.CreateSender(queueName);
	using ServiceBusMessageBatch messageBatch = await sender.CreateMessageBatchAsync();
	for (int i = 1; i <= numOfMessages; i++)
	{
		if (!messageBatch.TryAddMessage(new ServiceBusMessage($"Message {i}")))
		{
			throw new Exception($"The message {i} is too large to fit in the batch.");
		}
	}
	try
	{
		await sender.SendMessagesAsync(messageBatch);
		Console.WriteLine($"A batch of {numOfMessages} messages has been published to the queue.");
	}
	finally
	{
		await sender.DisposeAsync();
		await client.DisposeAsync();
	}
}
```


Save the **Program.cs** file. Launch the .NET Core console app.

> **Note**: If you encounter any errors, review the **Program.cs** file.


Verify that the console message displayed at the terminal prompt states that a batch of three messages has been published to queue. Switch to the browser displaying the Service Bus queue **messagequeue** in the Azure portal.

The following screenshot displays the Service Bus queue metrics and message count.

In the **Settings** section, select **Service Bus Explorer (preview)**. On the **Service Bus Explorer (preview)** blade, select the **Peek** tab header and, on the **Peek** tab, select the **Peek** button. Verify that the queue contains three messages. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/169298378-5673ebf7-b41c-41ae-97f9-6aba89d88d36.png)


Select the first message and review its content in the **Message** pane. The following screenshot displays the first message's content. Close the **Message** pane.

## Review

In this exercise, you configured your .NET project that published messages into an Azure Service Bus queue.


# Create a .NET Core project to read messages from a Service Bus queue


## Create a .NET project

Create a new .NET project named **MessageReader**. Import the **Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus** package from NuGet. Build the .NET Core console application.


## Read messages from an Azure Service Bus queue

On the code editor tab for the **Program.cs** file, delete all the code in the existing file. Add the same code which was included in the Program.cs file to allow for interaction with Azure Service Bus queues, but set the namespace to **MessageReader**.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
namespace MessageReader
{
   public class Program
   {
	  private const string storageConnectionString = "";
	  static string queueName = "messagequeue";
	  static ServiceBusClient client;
   }
}
```


As before, update the **storageConnectionString** string constant by setting its value to **Primary Connection String** of the **Service Bus** namespace you recorded earlier in this lab.


Enter the following code to create a ServiceBusProcessor that will be used to process messages from the queue:

```csharp
static ServiceBusProcessor processor;
```


Enter the following code to create a static async **MessageHandler** task that displays the body of messages in the queue as they are being processed and deletes them after the processing completes:

```csharp
static async Task MessageHandler(ProcessMessageEventArgs args)
{
	string body = args.Message.Body.ToString();
	Console.WriteLine($"Received: {body}");
	await args.CompleteMessageAsync(args.Message);
}
```


Enter the following code to create a static async **ErrorHandler** task that manages any exceptions encountered during message processing:

```csharp
static Task ErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(args.Exception.ToString());
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```


Enter the following code to create an asynchronous **Main** method:

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
}
```


Review the **Program.cs** file, which should now include the following code. The `<storage-connection-string>` placeholder represents the connection string to the target Azure Service Bus namespace:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
namespace MessageReader
{
	class Program
	{
		static string storageConnectionString = "";
		static string queueName = "messagequeue";
		static ServiceBusClient client;
		static ServiceBusProcessor processor;
		static async Task MessageHandler(ProcessMessageEventArgs args)
		{
			string body = args.Message.Body.ToString();
			Console.WriteLine($"Received: {body}");
			await args.CompleteMessageAsync(args.Message);
		}
		static Task ErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs args)
		{
			Console.WriteLine(args.Exception.ToString());
			return Task.CompletedTask;
		}
		static async Task Main()
		{
		}
	}
}
```


In the **Main** method, add the following code to initialize *client* of type **ServiceBusClient** that will provide connectivity to the Service Bus namespace and **processor** that will be responsible for processing of messages:

```csharp
client = new ServiceBusClient(storageConnectionString);
processor = client.CreateProcessor(queueName, new ServiceBusProcessorOptions());
```

> **Note**: As mentioned earlier, the Service Bus client is safe to cache and use as a singleton for the lifetime of the application. This is considered one of the best practices when publishing and reading messages on a regular basis.


In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to create a try block, which first implements a message and error processing handler, initiates message processing, and stops processing following a user input:

```csharp
try
{
	processor.ProcessMessageAsync += MessageHandler;
	processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ErrorHandler;
	await processor.StartProcessingAsync();
	Console.WriteLine("Wait for a minute and then press any key to end the processing");
	Console.ReadKey();
	Console.WriteLine("\nStopping the receiver...");
	await processor.StopProcessingAsync();
	Console.WriteLine("Stopped receiving messages");
}
```


In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to create a finally block that asynchronously disposes of the **processor** and **client** objects, releasing any network and unmanaged resources:

```csharp
finally
{
	await processor.DisposeAsync();
	await client.DisposeAsync();
}
```


Review the **Main** method, which should now consist of the following code:

```csharp
static async Task Main()
{
	client = new ServiceBusClient(storageConnectionString);
	processor = client.CreateProcessor(queueName, new ServiceBusProcessorOptions());
	try
	{
		processor.ProcessMessageAsync += MessageHandler;
		processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ErrorHandler;
		await processor.StartProcessingAsync();
		Console.WriteLine("Wait for a minute and then press any key to end the processing");
		Console.ReadKey();
		Console.WriteLine("\nStopping the receiver...");
		await processor.StopProcessingAsync();
		Console.WriteLine("Stopped receiving messages");
	}
	finally
	{
		await processor.DisposeAsync();
		await client.DisposeAsync();
	}
}
```

Save the **Program.cs** file. Launch the .NET Core console app

> **Note**: If you encounter any errors, review the **Program.cs** file in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\10\\Solution\\MessageReader** folder.


Verify that the console message displayed at the terminal prompt states that each of the three messages in the queue has been received.
