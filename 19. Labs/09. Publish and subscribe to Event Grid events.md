## Review

In this exercise, you created a new subscription, validated its registration, and then recorded the credentials required to publish a new event to the topic.


# Publish Event Grid events from .NET

## Create a .NET project

Create a new .NET console project named **EventPublisher**. Import **Azure.Messaging.EventGrid** from NuGet. Build the .NET web application. 


## Modify the Program class to connect to Event Grid

Open the **Program.cs** file. On the code editor tab for the **Program.cs** file, delete all the code in the existing file. Add the following line of code to import the **Azure**, and **Azure.Messaging.EventGrid** namespaces from the **Azure.Messaging.EventGrid** package imported from NuGet:

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.Messaging.EventGrid;
```


Add the following lines of code to add **using** directives for the built-in namespaces that will be used in this file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```


Enter the following code to create a new **Program** class:

```csharp
public class Program
{
}
```


In the **Program** class, enter the following line of code to create a new string constant named **topicEndpoint**:

```csharp
private const string topicEndpoint = "https://hrtopiczrz.eastus-1.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events";
```


Update the **topicEndpoint** string constant by setting its value to the **Topic Endpoint** of the Event Grid topic that you recorded previously in this lab.


In the **Program** class, enter the following line of code to create a new string constant named **topicKey**:

```csharp
private const string topicKey = "";
```


Update the **topicKey** string constant by setting its value to the **Key** of the Event Grid topic that you recorded previously in this lab.


In the **Program** class, enter the following code to create a new asynchronous **Main** method:

```csharp
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
}
```


Observe the **Program.cs** file, which should now include the following lines of code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure;
using Azure.Messaging.EventGrid;
public class Program
{
    private const string topicEndpoint = "<topic-endpoint>";
    private const string topicKey = "<topic-key>";
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
    }
}
```


## Publish new events


In the **Main** method, perform the following actions to publish a list of events to your topic endpoint:

Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **endpoint** of type **Uri**, using the **topicEndpoint** string constant as a constructor parameter:

```csharp
Uri endpoint = new Uri(topicEndpoint); 
```


Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **credential** of type **[AzureKeyCredential](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.azurekeycredential)**, using the **topicKey** string constant as a constructor parameter:

```csharp
AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential(topicKey);
```


Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **client** of type **[EventGridPublisherClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventgrid.eventgridpublisherclient)**, using the **endpoint** and **credential** variables as constructor parameters:

```csharp
EventGridPublisherClient client = new EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, credential);
```


Add the following block of code to create a new variable named **firstEvent** of type **[EventGridEvent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventgrid.eventgridevent)** and populate that variable with sample data:

```csharp
EventGridEvent firstEvent = new EventGridEvent(
    subject: $"New Employee: Alba Sutton",
    eventType: "Employees.Registration.New",
    dataVersion: "1.0",
    data: new
    {
        FullName = "Alba Sutton",
        Address = "4567 Pine Avenue, Edison, WA 97202"
     }
 );
 ```


Add the following block of code to create a new variable named **secondEvent** of type **[EventGridEvent](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventgrid.eventgridevent)** and populate that variable with sample data:

```csharp
EventGridEvent secondEvent = new EventGridEvent(
    subject: $"New Employee: Alexandre Doyon",
    eventType: "Employees.Registration.New",
    dataVersion: "1.0",
    data: new
    {
        FullName = "Alexandre Doyon",
        Address = "456 College Street, Bow, WA 98107"
    }
);
```


Add the following line of code to asynchronously invoke the **[EventGridPublisherClient.SendEventAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventgrid.eventgridpublisherclient.sendeventasync)** method using the **firstEvent** variable as a parameter:

```csharp
await client.SendEventAsync(firstEvent);
```


Add the following line of code to render the **"First event published"** message to the console:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("First event published");
```


Add the following line of code to asynchronously invoke the **[EventGridPublisherClient.SendEventAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventgrid.eventgridpublisherclient.sendeventasync)** method using the **secondEvent** variable as a parameter:

```csharp
await client.SendEventAsync(secondEvent);
```


Add the following line of code to render the **"Second event published"** message to the console:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Second event published");
```


Review the **Main** method, which should now include:

```csharp
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    Uri endpoint = new Uri(topicEndpoint);
    AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential(topicKey);
    EventGridPublisherClient client = new EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, credential);
    EventGridEvent firstEvent = new EventGridEvent(
        subject: $"New Employee: Alba Sutton",
        eventType: "Employees.Registration.New",
        dataVersion: "1.0",
        data: new
        {
            FullName = "Alba Sutton",
            Address = "4567 Pine Avenue, Edison, WA 97202"
        }
    );
    EventGridEvent secondEvent = new EventGridEvent(
        subject: $"New Employee: Alexandre Doyon",
        eventType: "Employees.Registration.New",
        dataVersion: "1.0",
        data: new
        {
            FullName = "Alexandre Doyon",
            Address = "456 College Street, Bow, WA 98107"
        }
    );
    await client.SendEventAsync(firstEvent);
    Console.WriteLine("First event published");
    await client.SendEventAsync(secondEvent);
    Console.WriteLine("Second event published");
}
```


Save the **Program.cs** file. Run the .NET web application.

> **Note**: If there are any build errors, review the **Program.cs**


## Observe published events

Return to the browser window with the **Azure Event Grid Viewer** web application. Review the **Employees.Registration.New** events that were created by your console application. Select any of the events and review its JSON content. Return to the Azure portal.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/169281427-680d4697-fbdd-4396-a67b-972092f81d8a.png)


## Review

In this exercise, you published new events to your Event Grid topic by using a .NET console application.


# Clean up your subscription

> **Note**: The command runs asynchronously (as determined by the *--no-wait* parameter), so while you'll be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it'll take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.


## Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.
