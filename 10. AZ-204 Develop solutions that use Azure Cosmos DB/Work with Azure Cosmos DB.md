# Explore Microsoft .NET SDK v3 for Azure Cosmos DB

This unit focuses on version 3 of the .NET SDK. (Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos NuGet package.) If you're familiar with the previous version of the .NET SDK, you may be used to the terms collection and document.

The [azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3/tree/master/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage) GitHub repository includes the latest .NET sample solutions. You use these solutions to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) and other common operations on Azure Cosmos DB resources.

Because Azure Cosmos DB supports multiple API models, version 3 of the .NET SDK uses the generic terms "container" and "item". A container can be a collection, graph, or table. An item can be a document, edge/vertex, or row, and is the content inside a container.

Below are examples showing some of the key operations you should be familiar with. For more examples please visit the GitHub link above. The examples below all use the async version of the methods.


# CosmosClient

Creates a new CosmosClient with a connection string. CosmosClient is thread-safe. Its recommended to maintain a single instance of CosmosClient per lifetime of the application which enables efficient connection management and performance.


```csharp
CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);
```


# Database examples

## Create a database

The CosmosClient.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync checks if a database exists, and if it doesn't, creates it. Only the database id is used to verify if there is an existing database.

```csharp
// An object containing relevant information about the response
DatabaseResponse databaseResponse = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseId, 10000);
```


## Read a database by ID

Reads a database from the Azure Cosmos service as an asynchronous operation.

```csharp
DatabaseResponse readResponse = await database.ReadAsync();
```


## Delete a database

Delete a Database as an asynchronous operation.

```csharp
await database.DeleteAsync();
```


# Container examples

## Create a container

The Database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync method checks if a container exists, and if it doesn't, it creates it. Only the container id is used to verify if there is an existing container.

```csharp
// Set throughput to the minimum value of 400 RU/s
ContainerResponse simpleContainer = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(
    id: containerId,
    partitionKeyPath: partitionKey,
    throughput: 400);
```


## Get a container by ID

```csharp
Container container = database.GetContainer(containerId);
ContainerProperties containerProperties = await container.ReadContainerAsync();
```


## Delete a container

Delete a Container as an asynchronous operation.

```csharp
await database.GetContainer(containerId).DeleteContainerAsync();
```


# Item examples

## Create an item

Use the Container.CreateItemAsync method to create an item. The method requires a JSON serializable object that must contain an id property, and a partitionKey.

```csharp
ItemResponse<SalesOrder> response = await container.CreateItemAsync(salesOrder, new PartitionKey(salesOrder.AccountNumber));
```

## Read an item

Use the Container.ReadItemAsync method to read an item. The method requires type to serialize the item to along with an id property, and a partitionKey.

```csharp
string id = "[id]";
string accountNumber = "[partition-key]";
ItemResponse<SalesOrder> response = await container.ReadItemAsync(id, new PartitionKey(accountNumber));
```

## Query an item

The Container.GetItemQueryIterator method creates a query for items under a container in an Azure Cosmos database using a SQL statement with parameterized values. It returns a FeedIterator.

```csharp
QueryDefinition query = new QueryDefinition(
    "select * from sales s where s.AccountNumber = @AccountInput ")
    .WithParameter("@AccountInput", "Account1");

FeedIterator<SalesOrder> resultSet = container.GetItemQueryIterator<SalesOrder>(
    query,
    requestOptions: new QueryRequestOptions()
    {
        PartitionKey = new PartitionKey("Account1"),
        MaxItemCount = 1
    });
```

# Create stored procedures

Azure Cosmos DB provides language-integrated, transactional execution of JavaScript that lets you write **stored procedures**, **triggers**, and **user-defined functions (UDFs)**. To call a stored procedure, trigger, or user-defined function, you need to register it. For more information, see [How to work with stored procedures, triggers, user-defined functions in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs).

**Note**

This unit focuses on stored procedures, the following unit covers triggers and user-defined functions.


## Writing stored procedures

Stored procedures can create, update, read, query, and delete items inside an Azure Cosmos container. Stored procedures are registered per collection, and can operate on any document or an attachment present in that collection.

Here is a simple stored procedure that returns a "Hello World" response.

```javascript
var helloWorldStoredProc = {
    id: "helloWorld",
    serverScript: function () {
        var context = getContext();
        var response = context.getResponse();

        response.setBody("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

The context object provides access to all operations that can be performed in Azure Cosmos DB, as well as access to the request and response objects. In this case, you use the response object to set the body of the response to be sent back to the client.


## Create an item using stored procedure

When you create an item by using stored procedure it is inserted into the Azure Cosmos container and an ID for the newly created item is returned. Creating an item is an asynchronous operation and depends on the JavaScript callback functions. The callback function has two parameters:

- The error object in case the operation fails
- A return value

Inside the callback, you can either handle the exception or throw an error. In case a callback is not provided and there is an error, the Azure Cosmos DB runtime will throw an error.

The stored procedure also includes a parameter to set the description, it's a boolean value. When the parameter is set to true and the description is missing, the stored procedure will throw an exception. Otherwise, the rest of the stored procedure continues to run.

The following example stored procedure takes an input parameter named documentToCreate and the parameterâ€™s value is the body of a document to be created in the current collection. The callback throws an error if the operation fails. Otherwise, it sets the id of the created document as the body of the response to the client.

```javascript
function createSampleDocument(documentToCreate) {
    var context = getContext();
    var collection = context.getCollection();
    var accepted = collection.createDocument(
        collection.getSelfLink(),
        documentToCreate,
        function (error, documentCreated) {                 
            context.getResponse().setBody(documentCreated.id)
        }
    );
    if (!accepted) return;
}
```


## Arrays as input parameters for stored procedures

When defining a stored procedure in the Azure portal, input parameters are always sent as a string to the stored procedure. Even if you pass an array of strings as an input, the array is converted to string and sent to the stored procedure. To work around this, you can define a function within your stored procedure to parse the string as an array. The following code shows how to parse a string input parameter as an array:

```javascript
function sample(arr) {
    if (typeof arr === "string") arr = JSON.parse(arr);

    arr.forEach(function(a) {
        // do something here
        console.log(a);
    });
}
```


## Bounded execution

All Azure Cosmos DB operations must complete within a limited amount of time. Stored procedures have a limited amount of time to run on the server. All collection functions return a Boolean value that represents whether that operation will complete or not


## Transactions within stored procedures

You can implement transactions on items within a container by using a stored procedure. JavaScript functions can implement a continuation-based model to batch or resume execution. The continuation value can be any value of your choice and your applications can then use this value to resume a transaction from a new starting point. The diagram below depicts how the transaction continuation model can be used to repeat a server-side function until the function finishes its entire processing workload.

# Create triggers and user-defined functions

Azure Cosmos DB supports pre-triggers and post-triggers. Pre-triggers are executed before modifying a database item and post-triggers are executed after modifying a database item. Triggers are not automatically executed, they must be specified for each database operation where you want them to execute. After you define a trigger, you should register it by using the Azure Cosmos DB SDKs.

For examples of how to register and call a trigger, see [pre-triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#pre-triggers) and [post-triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#post-triggers).


## Pre-triggers

The following example shows how a pre-trigger is used to validate the properties of an Azure Cosmos item that is being created, it adds a timestamp property to a newly added item if it doesn't contain one.

```javascript
function validateToDoItemTimestamp() {
    var context = getContext();
    var request = context.getRequest();

    // item to be created in the current operation
    var itemToCreate = request.getBody();

    // validate properties
    if (!("timestamp" in itemToCreate)) {
        var ts = new Date();
        itemToCreate["timestamp"] = ts.getTime();
    }

    // update the item that will be created
    request.setBody(itemToCreate);
}
```

Pre-triggers cannot have any input parameters. The request object in the trigger is used to manipulate the request message associated with the operation. In the previous example, the pre-trigger is run when creating an Azure Cosmos item, and the request message body contains the item to be created in JSON format.

When triggers are registered, you can specify the operations that it can run with. This trigger should be created with a TriggerOperation value of TriggerOperation.Create, which means using the trigger in a replace operation is not permitted.

For examples of how to register and call a pre-trigger, visit the [pre-triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#pre-triggers) article.


## Post-triggers

The following example shows a post-trigger. This trigger queries for the metadata item and updates it with details about the newly created item.

```javascript
function updateMetadata() {
var context = getContext();
var container = context.getCollection();
var response = context.getResponse();

// item that was created
var createdItem = response.getBody();

// query for metadata document
var filterQuery = 'SELECT * FROM root r WHERE r.id = "_metadata"';
var accept = container.queryDocuments(container.getSelfLink(), filterQuery,
    updateMetadataCallback);
if(!accept) throw "Unable to update metadata, abort";

function updateMetadataCallback(err, items, responseOptions) {
    if(err) throw new Error("Error" + err.message);
        if(items.length != 1) throw 'Unable to find metadata document';

        var metadataItem = items[0];

        // update metadata
        metadataItem.createdItems += 1;
        metadataItem.createdNames += " " + createdItem.id;
        var accept = container.replaceDocument(metadataItem._self,
            metadataItem, function(err, itemReplaced) {
                    if(err) throw "Unable to update metadata, abort";
            });
        if(!accept) throw "Unable to update metadata, abort";
        return;
    }
}
```

One thing that is important to note is the transactional execution of triggers in Azure Cosmos DB. The post-trigger runs as part of the same transaction for the underlying item itself. An exception during the post-trigger execution will fail the whole transaction. Anything committed will be rolled back and an exception returned.


## User-defined functions

The following sample creates a UDF to calculate income tax for various income brackets. This user-defined function would then be used inside a query. For the purposes of this example assume there is a container called "Incomes" with properties as follows:

```javascript
{
   "name": "User One",
   "country": "USA",
   "income": 70000
}
```

The following is a function definition to calculate income tax for various income brackets:

```javascript
function tax(income) {

        if(income == undefined)
            throw 'no input';

        if (income < 1000)
            return income * 0.1;
        else if (income < 10000)
            return income * 0.2;
        else
            return income * 0.4;
    }
```

```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/163837062-5cf51bc1-b32b-4c82-8078-0fdb356e675f.png)


## Set up the console application

Create C# Console App with VS Code or VS


## Build the console app

## Add packages and using statements

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos
```


## Add using statements to include Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos and to enable async operations.

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;
```


## Add code to connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account

Replace the entire class Program with the code snippet below. The code snippet adds constants and variables into the class and adds some error checking. Be sure to replace the placeholder values for EndpointUri and PrimaryKey following the directions in the code comments.

```csharp
public class Program
{
    // Replace <documentEndpoint> with the information created earlier
    private static readonly string EndpointUri = "<documentEndpoint>";

    // Set variable to the Primary Key from earlier.
    private static readonly string PrimaryKey = "<your primary key>";

    // The Cosmos client instance
    private CosmosClient cosmosClient;

    // The database we will create
    private Database database;

    // The container we will create.
    private Container container;

    // The names of the database and container we will create
    private string databaseId = "az204Database";
    private string containerId = "az204Container";

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Beginning operations...\n");
            Program p = new Program();
            await p.CosmosAsync();

        }
        catch (CosmosException de)
        {
            Exception baseException = de.GetBaseException();
            Console.WriteLine("{0} error occurred: {1}", de.StatusCode, de);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: {0}", e);
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine("End of program, press any key to exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Below the Main method, add a new asynchronous task called CosmosAsync, which instantiates our new CosmosClient.

```csharp
public async Task CosmosAsync()
{
    // Create a new instance of the Cosmos Client
    this.cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(EndpointUri, PrimaryKey);
}
```


## Create a database

Copy and paste the CreateDatabaseAsync method after the CosmosAsync method. CreateDatabaseAsync creates a new database with ID az204Database if it doesn't already exist.


```csharp
private async Task CreateDatabaseAsync()
{
    // Create a new database using the cosmosClient
    this.database = await this.cosmosClient.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseId);
    Console.WriteLine("Created Database: {0}\n", this.database.Id);
}
```

Add the code below at the end of the CosmosAsync method, it calls the CreateDatabaseAsync method you just added.

```csharp
// Runs the CreateDatabaseAsync method
    await this.CreateDatabaseAsync();
```


## Create a container

Copy and paste the CreateContainerAsync method below the CreateDatabaseAsync method.

```csharp
private async Task CreateContainerAsync()
{
    // Create a new container
    this.container = await this.database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(containerId, "/LastName");
    Console.WriteLine("Created Container: {0}\n", this.container.Id);
}
```

Copy and paste the code below where you instantiated the CosmosClient to call the CreateContainer method you just added.

```csharp
// Run the CreateContainerAsync method
await this.CreateContainerAsync();
```


## Run the application

Save your work and, in a terminal in VS Code, run the dotnet run command. The console will display the following messages.

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Clean up Azure resources

```bash
az group delete --name az204-cosmos-rg --no-wait
```
